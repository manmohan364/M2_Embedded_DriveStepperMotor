# M2_Embedded_ProjectGoal
 ProjectName: M2_Embedded_Motorvehiclemonitoring                                                                     
 The Vehicle Monitoring System (V.M.S.) developed, focuses on monitoring a vehicle
which is fitted with this system inside it. Once this system is activated, it will keep on
continuously monitoring the location, co content and accident scenarios inside the vehicle.
As long as the V.M.S. is up and running and is powered on, it will keep on doing its
specified activities as has been tasked to do so.
In our project, the main aim is to design and develop a system that is capable of monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

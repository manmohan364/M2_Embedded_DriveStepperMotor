## Introduction
In the era of Artificial Intelligence, self-driving cars are going to be the future where
autonomy will lie in the hands of the circuits of the autonomous vehicles. Along with
autonomous vehicles, there will be manually-driven vehicles on the road too. So to ensure
safety and security, check condition and improve vehicular efficiency, the implication of
vehicle monitoring in businesses today is really impressive.The Vehicle Monitoring System (V.M.S.) developed, focuses on monitoring a vehicle
which is fitted with this system inside it. Once this system is activated, it will keep on
continuously monitoring the location, co content and accident scenarios inside the vehicle.
As long as the V.M.S. is up and running and is powered on, it will keep on doing its
specified activities as has been tasked to do so.
In our project, the main aim is to design and develop a system that is capable of monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Introduction
In the era of Artificial Intelligence, self-driving cars are going to be the future where
autonomy will lie in the hands of the circuits of the autonomous vehicles. Along with
autonomous vehicles, there will be manually-driven vehicles on the road too. So to ensure
safety and security, check condition and improve vehicular efficiency, the implication of
vehicle monitoring in businesses today is really impressive.The Vehicle Monitoring System (V.M.S.) developed, focuses on monitoring a vehicle
which is fitted with this system inside it. Once this system is activated, it will keep on
continuously monitoring the location, co content and accident scenarios inside the vehicle.
As long as the V.M.S. is up and running and is powered on, it will keep on doing its
specified activities as has been tasked to do so.
In our project, the main aim is to design and develop a system that is capable of monitoring the passenger's existence and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Research ðŸš˜
The vehicle monitoring system serves a lot of purposes based on the environment in
which it is deployed in. It can be configured, modified or redesigned with ease to act
accordingly, as and when needed, based on the requirements of the environment.Comfort Control Systems do more for us today than ever before. They are in charge of keeping your air clean, cooling your car down on a hot summers day, and Keeping your car going at a single speed using Cruise Control.This microcontroller is used in a large number of machines like automobiles as it can be easily integrated around a machine.


# Features
-The passanger can change the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system                                       
-Modular Based Programming.                                                                                                                
-Driver and the passanger can have the access to chaning the temperature in the vehicle.                             
-Its capable of determining weather the user is exist or not in the vehicle.

# Strenght
-Low cost.                                                                                                         
-Modular Based Programs.                                                                                               
-User Friendly.                                                                                                        
-The vehicle it will gives the indication.                                                                                          
-Easy to modify the temperature value.
# Weakness 
This system is useful only (climate/temperature) where temperature is low.
# Opportunities
If small change can be done user like heater is replaced by the air conditioners this will be work every climate/ temperature.
# Threats
High Temperature range.
# 4W 
## WHERE 
Used in automotive industry
## WHEN 
At low temperature.
##WHAT 
Passanger Seat and Heat Monitoring System
## WHY 
Comfertness of human beings.

# 1 H
## HOW 
Operates and changing in the temperature.
